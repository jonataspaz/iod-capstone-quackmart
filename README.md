IOD Capstone Project 

This project involves the creation of a customer-to-customer marketplace within a web application. The platform is designed to facilitate the selling of goods by customers to other customers. What sets this online marketplace apart is a feature that allows for the upload of 3D files of products. This innovative functionality provides a more engaging method of product marketing, as it enables interactive displays. Furthermore, the web application includes a feature through which customers can upload videos of their products. Leveraging an integrated API, these videos are converted into 3D files, which can subsequently be uploaded onto the respective product page, allowing for an enhanced visual representation of the product.
